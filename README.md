<h1>Comments</h1>

* This project was developed by myself and 3 other developers in our senior software engineering course. Two students Karan and Omar [social handles will be linked below] were responsible for building the front end while I build the backend and one more student by the name of Aman did QA and assisted me in backend design/development

* This app took us 16 weeks to ship and we worked tremendously as a team. I do not take full credit for this code, as I was an integral part of the team, but not the sole contributor.
